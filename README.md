## How do I approach designing software?
#### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I think the biggest skill this course has helped me with is in handling pointers. I don't have a whole lot of experience with pointers and passing by reference, so this course was helpful in that way. 

#### What design process did you follow for your project work?
My design process included mapping out all of the components needed for all of the objects I was going to be rendering in my virtual scene. I actually used an excel document and tracked each stage of the development for each of the dozen or so items in order to keep from forgetting any single component.

#### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I already employ this technique when setting up the build environments at my current job. I know beforehand what components need to be implemented so I have an excel sheet that I use to track my progress as I build the software system. 

## How do I approach developing programs?
### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
In the course of working on developing this scene I really tried to focus on how I was introducing these objects. One of the methods I used was naming conventions that allowed me to match the object I was creating with it's appropriate shaders and mesh. 

#### How did iteration factor into your development?
It took many iterations for several stages of the development. For example, the lighting alone for each object needed several iterations and then placing them in the scene also required many iterations for each object. I think these two factors alone accounted for around a hundred iterations. Then throw in the iterations for getting the texturing correct as well as the iterations for placing the camera, light, and background color and I was probably in the two hundred range. 

#### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
As these courses have progressed in difficulty my approach to development has progressed in its complexity. This also true throughout this course. The first milestone or two were relatively easy in that there was a single object and then different layers began to be added on. Lighting, texture, camera movement, and the rest of the stages each added to the project and thus my need to plan out my development prior to actually writing any code increased exponentially. 

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science has already helped me reach my goals in that I am a full-time software engineer. Obviously, it will help me continue to thrive in this career field as it is directly related to computer science. 

#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Honestly one of the biggest takeaways from this course is how much I learned about how the CPU's memory management works. I think that understanding is something I will be able to carry with me throughout my entire educational and professional career. 

#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Having that practice of maintaining a mental map of the program you're writing is a skill worth its weight in gold and working on this project, especially working on the vertices in the mesh, has made that skill so much sharper. Having to build the object in your head and understand where each vertex needed to be really hammered home that skill in a unique way that has already begun to translate well in my professional career.
